# eShellDroid

Minimal open-source **frames-only** proof-of-concept for **eArc**.

This repository demonstrates a deterministic, local-first architecture where
**Frames are the only data format** and meaning comes before interface.

## What this is
- Frames-first architecture (atomic units of meaning)
- Local storage, offline-first
- Pull-based RSS ingest (no push)
- No tracking, no identity, no auto-send
- Deterministic structure, reproducible layout

## What this is not
- Not a product
- Not a social platform
- Not an automated network
- Not a surveillance system

## Repository structure
- `/release/` → canonical release artifacts  
  - Android Shell PoC (source bundle)
  - Nano Translator (Frame → Text, read-only)
  - Release documentation

## Status
Proof-of-Concept · public · open-source · MIT licensed
